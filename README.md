# Fortinet Cloud Architectures

In this repository you can find some reference architectures of Fortinet Solutions deployed in Public Cloud.

All the files are available in two versions for each Cloud Provider. The first one is a .drawio file with several sections for each architecture and all the needed items to adapt it to your needs. For those who aren't familiar with Draw.io, you can find the application in this URL: https://draw.io 

Apart from the editable file you can find several PNG files that results of exporting the different architectures and can be directly used in any other documentation.

I hope you find them useful.
